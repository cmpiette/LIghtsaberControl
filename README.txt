This is a demo of a multidisciplinary passion project I've been chipping away at as time and resources allow. The end goal is a functional prop of the iconic lightsaber from Star Wars, and this is achieved via the attached Arduino code. I have included a txt file containing the code, since the .ino file will require the Arduino IDE to properly view. 

The primary user-facing functionality is the color switching method, which causes the color of the saber's blade to cycle through the color wheel while the correspondent button is held. Also implemented are a natural brightness cycling effect referred to in the source as "scintillation" and a "flash on clash" feature to emulate the lightsaber making contact with another object. In the future I plan to attach an accelerometer and speaker to the breadboard. This will allow the saber to trigger sounds depending on its state of movement, be it idle, mid-swing, or clashing.

I have attached a "sound font" folder, containing the sounds I have created that will play on saber motion. I have also attached screenshots of 3D-printer-ready models I have created, which will slide over the saber's metal tube enclosure to complete its aesthetic.
